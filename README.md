# BioDock üß¨
*A standardized platform for containerized bioinformatics pipeline management.*

## üåü Overview
BioDock is a desktop application that revolutionizes how bioinformatics workflows are shared and executed. Built around a "pipeline-as-a-package" philosophy, BioDock enables researchers to package their workflows as standardized Docker containers with JSON configuration files, while providing wet lab biologists with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to execute these pipelines without dealing with dependencies, environment setup, or command-line complexity.

### The BioDock Approach
- **For Pipeline Authors**: Package your workflow as a Dockerfile + JSON configuration and share it with the community
- **For End Users**: Simply drag-and-drop your input files, select a pipeline, and get results - BioDock handles everything else
- **For Everyone**: Reproducible, containerized execution ensures consistent results across different systems


## üöÄ Features

### For End Users
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface** ‚Äì Load input files and execute pipelines instantly
- **Standardized Pipeline Library** ‚Äì Access validated, containerized workflows 
- **Project Management** ‚Äì Organize samples, track analysis history, and manage results
- **Built-in Report Viewer** ‚Äì View analysis results and reports directly in the app
- **Cross-Platform** ‚Äì Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Docker

### For Pipeline Developers
- **Pipeline Creator Interface** ‚Äì Visual tool for defining Dockerfile and JSON configurations
- **Standardized Package Format** ‚Äì Consistent structure for sharing and distributing workflows
- **Container Integration** ‚Äì Built-in Docker support for dependency management
- **Validation Tools** ‚Äì Ensure pipeline packages meet quality standards before sharing

### Core Capabilities  
- **Reproducible Execution** ‚Äì Docker containers ensure consistent results across environments
- **Multi-Format Support** ‚Äì Handle various bioinformatics file types (FASTQ, FASTA, BAM, etc.)
- **Provenance Tracking** ‚Äì Complete audit trail of tool versions, commands, and execution details
- **Metadata Management** ‚Äì Integrated support for sample sheets and experimental metadata

## üîß Installation
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Download the BioDock installer from [Releases](https://github.com/antonio-dimeglio/BioDock/releases).
3. Launch the app ‚Äì everything else is handled automatically.

## üß™ Quick Start

### Running Your First Analysis
1. **Install BioDock** and ensure Docker is running
2. **Create a New Project** or open an existing one
3. **Drag & Drop Input Files** into the sample area
4. **Select a Pipeline** from the available library (e.g., FastQC Quality Control)
5. **Click Run** and monitor progress in real-time
6. **View Results** directly in the integrated report viewer

### Creating Your First Pipeline Package
1. **Open Pipeline Creator** from the main menu
2. **Define Pipeline Metadata** (name, description, version)
3. **Load Your Dockerfile** containing your workflow tools
4. **Configure Input/Output** file types and directory mappings
5. **Preview and Validate** your pipeline configuration
6. **Export Pipeline Package** for sharing or local use

### Example Pipeline JSON Structure
```json
{
  "id": "my-workflow-v1.0",
  "name": "My Custom Workflow",
  "description": "Custom analysis pipeline for my research",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "command": ["my-tool", "--input", "/input", "--output", "/output"],
  "inputFileTypes": ["fastq", "fq"],
  "outputFileTypes": ["html", "txt"],
  "inputDirectory": "/input",
  "outputDirectory": "/output"
}
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Current Implementation (v0.x)
- [x] Core JavaFX application architecture
- [x] Project management and drag-and-drop file loading
- [x] Pipeline data model with JSON serialization
- [x] Basic FastQC pipeline configuration
- [x] Pipeline Creator interface scaffolding

### Version 1.0 Goals
- [ ] **Complete Docker Service** - Full container management and execution
- [ ] **Pipeline Validation Engine** - Automated testing of pipeline packages
- [ ] **Result Processing System** - Report generation and visualization
- [ ] **Multiple Sample Support** - Batch processing capabilities
- [ ] **Pipeline Library Management** - Local pipeline storage and organization
- [ ] **Advanced File Format Support** - Beyond FASTQ (BAM, FASTA, etc.)

### Future Vision (Post v1.0)
- [ ] **Centralized Pipeline Repository** - Community-driven pipeline sharing platform
- [ ] **Advanced Search & Discovery** - Browse pipelines by category, rating, usage
- [ ] **One-Click Pipeline Installation** - Direct download from central repository
- [ ] **Community Features** - Pipeline ratings, reviews, and collaboration tools
- [ ] **Quality Assurance System** - Automated validation and testing of community contributions
- [ ] **Version Management** - Semantic versioning with dependency tracking

### Long-term Impact
Transform BioDock into a comprehensive ecosystem for bioinformatics workflow management, similar to how Docker Hub revolutionized container sharing but specifically tailored for computational biology research.
