## üìù Notes for Development

**Immediate Next Steps (This Week):**
1. Fix DockerService volume mounting issues
2. Test end-to-end pipeline execution with FastQC
3. Implement basic result collection
4. Create comprehensive error handling

**Key Design Principles to Maintain:**
- Keep UI simple and intuitive for wet lab biologists
- Maintain flexibility for both basic and advanced users  
- Ensure all operations are reversible and safe
- Prioritize data integrity and result reproducibility

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test each phase incrementally before moving to the next
- Always test with real bioinformatics data and workflows
- Include both automated tests and manual user testing
- Document all test scenarios and edge cases

*This TODO will be updated regularly as development progresses and priorities evolve.*
